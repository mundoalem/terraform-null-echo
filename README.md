A terraform module that echoes its input message to an output.

## Introduction

The `echo` module received a message as an input variable and just output the same value as an output. This module
is only meant to be used to test terraform automation such as the DevOps templates developed by us, like a
`"Hello, World!"` exercise for a programming language.

## Usage

```
module "echo" {
  source  = "mundoalem/echo/null"
  version = "1.0.0"
}
```

## Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of
gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, income or similar personal
characteristic.

Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude. Respect that people have
differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and
numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer, merely an optimal answer given a set of values
and circumstances.

Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment
with, make a fork and see how it works.

We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome
behavior. We interpret the term "harassment" as including the definition in the
[Citizen Code](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/) of Conduct; if you have any lack of clarity
about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition. In particular,
we don't tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.

Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe
place for you and we've got your back.

Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not
welcome.

## Communication

GitHub issues are the primary way for communicating about specific proposed changes to this project.

In both contexts, please follow the conduct guidelines above. Language issues are often contentious
and we'd like to keep discussion brief, civil and focused on what we're actually doing, not wandering
off into too much imaginary stuff.
